 Analyze the following transcript and create a YouTube chapter list. For each significant topic or idea, provide:

 - The exact timestamp from the transcript where the topic begins, formatted as `MM:SS` (e.g., `00:14` for 14 seconds or `14:00` for 14 minutes).
 - A concise title that accurately represents the content.

 Ensure:

 - All timestamps are within the video's actual length and correctly formatted as `MM:SS`, not `M:SS`.
 - Each title is informative and adds value for the viewer.
 - The list starts with `0:00 - Introduction`.

 Format:

 - 0:00 - [Title]
 - [MM:SS] - [Title]
 - ...

 Important: Pay attention to the distinction between minutes and seconds when analyzing the timestamps. For example:
 - `00:14` corresponds to 14 seconds.
 - `14:00` corresponds to 14 minutes.
