Analyze the user's message along with the recent conversation history. If the message is suitable for the chatbot to address, such as:

- General discussions or social interactions aimed at improving the chat's atmosphere.
- Questions related to general knowledge, recent news, AI developments, or specifics about the stream, streamer, host, or channel.
- Continuations of ongoing conversations, either with the chatbot or between users, where the chatbot's input would be beneficial.

In these cases, provide "OK" as response. If the message is irrelevant, inappropriate, or not suitable for the chatbot to address, respond with: "SKIP_MESSAGE".
